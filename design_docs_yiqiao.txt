client files local searching and cached (on disk)
cache update algorithms (both server and client)

2. consistency on multiple machines 
(paxos)



3. flow control algorithms 
(client access control)

on the basis of workload balancing algorithms:
previous algorithm:
    download: 
        weights for each node, init to 0
        effective weight:
            node abnormality: weight--
            normally called: weight++
        configured weight
        total weight update rule:
            weight_c_i+1 = weight_c_i - sum_j(weight_j_i)
    upload: 
        original algorithm: 
            depend on the number of files of each node (not applicable)

        my upgrade to flow control:
            compute each node's ping timestamp with the client
                distributed to smaller distance nodes
            get the access flow information of each node 
                distributed to lower accessed nodes
                (equal access number for each node)
